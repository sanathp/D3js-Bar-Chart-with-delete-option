D3js-Bar-Chart-with-delete-option
=================================

This is a d3 js bar chart with tooltips and delete option for each bar in the chart  .

The problem with a bar chart is if a single value is very big then the bar for other values are not visible .So if you are displaying data through bar chart from a database if one of the input value is very big then user cant see other values and cant compare them .

This d3graph provides an option to delete a bar from the bar chart . So if the user clicks on delete button deletes the bar with bigger vlue gets deleted and the graphs will be redrawn with the remaining values .
